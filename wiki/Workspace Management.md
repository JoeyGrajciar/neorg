# Managing Workspaces in Neorg

Workspaces allow you to define a bunch of predetermined locations that Neorg should take into account.
These locations can then be used by modules to give them a good sense of where they "are" at any moment in time.
It also allows you to stay organized and keep everything in only a place or two.

### Using `core.norg.dirman`
Dirman is your best bro! He will do all the thinking for you, you just gotta tell him the directories and he'll handle the rest.
Here's how you'd do that:

- First, we gotta load the module:
  ```lua
  use {
    "vhyrro/neorg",
    config = function()
        require('neorg').setup {
            load = {
                ["core.defaults"] = {},
                ["core.norg.concealer"] = {},
                ["core.norg.dirman"] = {} -- Load dirman!
            }
        }
    end
  }
  ```
- Perfect! Next up, we have to configure it:


  ```lua
  use {
    "vhyrro/neorg",
    config = function()
        require('neorg').setup {
            load = {
                ["core.defaults"] = {},
                ["core.norg.concealer"] = {},
                ["core.norg.dirman"] = {
                    config = { -- Load a custom configuration

                        -- Define your workspaces here!
                        workspaces = {
                            -- You can give it any name and any directory, get creative!
                            my_workspace = "~/neorg",
                            another_workspace = "~/dev/work/notes" -- Or wherever you want
                        },
                         
                        -- Automatically detect whenever we have entered a subdirectory of a workspace
                        autodetect = true,
                        -- Automatically change the directory to the root of the workspace every time 
                        autochdir = true,
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    end
  }
  ```

That's it! We now have a configured dirman. So, what can we do? First of all, if `autodetect` is `true`, then
dirman will automatically detect whenever we enter a workspace root. If it does detect a workspace root it will set
that as the current workspace and change directory into that root. If `autochdir` is set to `true` dirman will keep us in
our workspace directory, no matter what. You can `cd` out of that directory temporarily with e.g. nvim-tree, but
dirman will pull you back into your workspace root as soon as it can.

With that out of the way, let's see how we can interact with workspaces: we can use a dedicated `:Neorg` command
generated by dirman of course!
- `:Neorg workspace` - simply prints the current workspace (its name and the directory it points to)
- `:Neorg workspace <ws_name>` - changes workspaces. You can use tab completion here as an aid. Upon changing to a different
  workspace all modules will be notified and your current directory will be changed to the workspace's root.

That's it! That's how easy it is to organize your files.

Workspaces will also be very useful to give insightful information to e.g. telescope.nvim regarding where to fuzzy find your notes,
and much, much more. Stay tuned!
